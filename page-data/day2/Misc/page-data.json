Developers can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents of projects.  \nAfter your OCP installation is completed then you can immediately access the Web Console.

Maintaining all previous versions of all the objects may end up consuming significant amount of storage which may have an impact on the performance of elements of the platform.  \n\nThe following are some area that might to be reviewed regularly:\n- etcd data storage. Big etcd structure may slowdown the response of any activity related to etcd.\n- local container registry. Big registry will slow down the push and pull image operation.\n- /var/lib/containers. This is the location of the container runtime and container ephermeral storage area.  \n\nPruning of logfiles is frequently also a task that needs to be performed as a Day-2 activity.
