For example, by pruning images you can delete older images and layers that are no longer in use, but are still taking up disk space.  \n- Pruning groups\n- Pruning deployments\n- Pruning builds\n- Pruning images\n- Pruning cron jobs  \n\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/applications/pruning-objects.html\n\n\n\n## Garbage Collection\nThere are two types of Garbage Collection\n- Container Garbage collection.\n- Image Garbage collection.\n\nBoth of these can be tuned by modifying the the Kubelet argument settings at the Node ConfigMap.
